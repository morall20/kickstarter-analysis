# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign

In this analysis I'm assign to help Louise launch a Kickstarter campaign based on the data of Kickstarter campaigns.

I started first by applying a filter to parent category "Theather" and focusing on the subcategories of "plays" in the "US" that were "successful".

Then I created a chart that shows the Kickstarter campaigns outcomes for the "Theather" catagory based on their launched dates. Note that the steep climb between the months April to June with May te peek month.

## Summary statistics

To establish a successful goal for Louise fundraising campaign I used the central tendency of Mean and Median and a standard deviation to the interquartile range of the goals and pledged funds for both the successful and failed campaigns based on US data. Based from the a successful campaign data the Mean came to $3,000 and Median was $5,049; while the failed campaign resulted in a Mean of 10,550 and a Median of $ 5,000.

In order for Louise to make a successful play she have to produce her play for less than $5,000; and should launched her campaign around June 
or July to maximize the chance of success.

### CHALLENGE

Below provides quick visual summarization for the play subcategory; the "successful" campaigns trended in a negative path as the fundraising goals grew, while the "failed" campaigns trend in positve direction as the goals grew.
