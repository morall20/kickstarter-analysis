# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign

In this analysis I'm assigned to help Louise launch a Kickstarter campaign based on the data from the Kickstarter campaigns.

I started first by applying a filter to the parent category "Theater" and focusing on the subcategories of "plays" in the "US" that were "successful".

Then I created a chart that shows Kickstarter campaign outcomes for the "Theater" category based on their launch dates. Note the steep climb between the months of April to June with May being the peak month.

## Summary statistics

To establish a successful goal for Louise's fundraising campaign, I used the central tendency of Mean and Median and a standard deviation to the interquartile range of the goals and pledged funds for both the successful and failed campaigns based on US data. Based on successful campaign data the Mean came to $3,000 and Median was $5,049; while the failed campaign resulted in a Mean of 10,550 and a Median of $ 5,000.

In order for Louise to make a successful play she has to produce her play for less than $5,000; and should launch her campaign around June 
or July to maximize the chance of success.

### CHALLENGE

Below provides a quick visual summarization for the play subcategory; the "successful" campaigns trended in a negative path as the fundraising goals grew, while the "failed" campaigns trend in positve direction as the goals grew.
